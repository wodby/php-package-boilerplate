# PHP Composer boilerplate

Fork of https://github.com/elliotjreed/php-package-boilerplate

Simple PHP composer-based boilerplate with a build pipeline to be used for Wodby 2.0 service https://github.com/wodby/service-php as a part of generic PHP stack https://github.com/wodby/stack-php

## Changes

- Added Wodby CI pipeline
- Changed `public/example.php` to `public/index.php` to work with https://github.com/wodby/nginx PHP preset out of the box
